				    <p>The Eclipse Hourse rules, are rather hard to track down (although they are refered to often). The best source is the "Contributing to Eclipse" book mentioned on the project reading list. </p>

<h3><a name="EclipseHouseRules-ExtenderRules">Extender Rules</a></h3>
<p>ie using an extention point</p>

<p>Contribution Rule: Everything is a contribution<br/>
Conformance Rule: Contributions must conform to expected interfaces<br/>
Sharing Rule: Add, don?t replace<br/>
Monkey See Monkey Do Rule: Always start by copying the structure of a similar plug-in<br/>
Relevance Rule: Contribute only when you can successfully operate<br/>
Integration Rule: Integrate, don't separate<br/>
Responsibility Rule: Clearly identify your plug-in as the source of problems<br/>
Program To API Contract Rule: Check and program to the Eclipse API contract<br/>
Other Rule Rule: Make all contributions available, but put those that don't typically apply to<br/>
the current perspective in an Other... dialog<br/>
Adapt to IResource Rule: Whenever possible, define an IResource adapter for your domain<br/>
objects<br/>
Strata Rule: Separate language-neutral functionality from language-specific functionality and<br/>
separate core functionality from UI functionality<br/>
User Continuity Rule: Preserve the user interface state across sessions</p>

<h3><a name="EclipseHouseRules-EnablerRule">Enabler Rule</a></h3>
<p>ie providing an extention point</p>

<p>Invitation Rule: Whenever possible, let others contribute to your contributions<br/>
Lazy Loading Rule: Contributions are only loaded when they are needed<br/>
Safe Platform Rule: As the provider of an extension point, you must protect yourself against<br/>
misbehavior on the part of extenders<br/>
Fair Play Rule: All clients play by the same rules, even me<br/>
Explicit Extension: Declare explicitly where a platform can be extended<br/>
Diversity Rule: Extension points accept multiple extensions<br/>
Good Fences: When passing control outside your code, protect yourself<br/>
User Arbitration Rule: When there are multiple applicable contributions, let the user decide<br/>
which one to use<br/>
Explicit API Rule : separate the API from internals<br/>
Stability Rule: Once you invite someone to contribute, don?t change the rules<br/>
Defensive API Rule: Reveal only the API in which you are confident, but be prepared to reveal<br/>
more API as clients ask for it</p>

<h3><a name="EclipseHouseRules-Publisher">Publisher</a></h3>
<p>ie sharing your plugin with others</p>

<p>License Rule: Always supply a license with every contribution</p>
