				    <p>The uDig application manages your content in the following data structure:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Project: represents a location, on disk where your content is saved</li>
	<li>Map: represents a visualization of spatial information, makes use of a ViewPort indicating the area of interest</li>
	<li>Layer: a Map is composed of Layers, indicating which spatial information is to be drawn (and in what order)</li>
</ul>


<p>Because this is a dynamic application we ask you not to hack away at these datastructures as the system is running (to do so often freezes the screen). Instead we ask you to assemble a <a href="http://udig.refractions.net/confluence/display/DEV/4+Commands" title="Visit page outside Confluence">command</a> that will be issued in the user interface thread.</p>

<p>uDig is highly threaded, as benefits a client application, ensuring that "work" happens in the correct thread is a large benefit provided to you by the GIS Application.</p>

<p>The API available to you for a Map is three fold: that which is available all the time (such as the File), that which will need to block (accessing the File), and that which can only be used via a <a href="http://udig.refractions.net/confluence/display/DEV/4+Commands" title="Visit page outside Confluence">command </a> (modifying the contents).</p>
