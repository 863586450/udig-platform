<h1>uDig 1.3.0 Released</h1>

<p>The uDig Community is pleased to announce the release of the uDig 1.3.2.</p>

<p>This point release packs significant new functionality. Thanks to our Google Summer of Code
students for taking part in this years program. Macro Foi completed his work porting the advanced
edit tools into this release.</p>

<p>
There are a large number of people to thank for the nuts and bolts of this release. Cliff
Broadbent and Sam Guymer transitioning the project to the tycho build system. Andrea Antonello
setup the dropins folder for easy plugin installation. Jody Garnett and Frank Gasdorf ported
the documentation and walkthroughs into Restructured Text resulting in a nice clean look.
</p>

<p>This release is made in conjunction with GeoTools 8.1.</p>

<h2>About uDig 1.3.2</h2>
<p>
The 1.3.2 release showcases active assistance when writing CQL expressions and filters.
This technology will be used to making editing styles a more rewarding and dynamic experience.</p>
<p>
The 1.3 series features some great usability improvements with a new tool palette and easy to
access tool options. For developers the uDig platform provides access to the latest open source
libraries from an Eclipse RCP environment.</p>
<p>
Here are some new features you can look forward to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Import SLD 1.1 Styles</li>
  <li>Edit Tools included - no longer require a separate download</li>
  <li>Area - define your area of interest based on CRS, current screen or a bookmark. You can use the
     area of interest to filter a Map Layer or just the Table view. This is a great way to focus on
     just the content you are interested in.</li>
  <li>Query Layers using a dynamic filter editor, there is also a checkbox to filter using the area
      of interest. Can be used to answer simple feature containment questions.</li>
