There is a <a href="http://udig.refractions.net/confluence/display/ADMIN/Create+an+installer">wiki
page</a> which may have more recent instructions.</p>
<p>
In order to compile the installer script, you'll need to download and install NSIS installer.</p>
<p>
This program can be downloaded from here: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/</p>
<p>

It shouldn't matter where you install this program.</p>
<p>

The install script can be edited with any text editor, and is the file titled uDigInstallScript.nsi</p>
<p>

This file and the other files contained in the Installer Tools.zip archive should all lie in the
root of the uDIG install directory - that is to say, in the same folder that contains the "udig"
directory.</p>
<p>

To recompile the installer for a new version of uDig, you'll need to do the following:</p>
<p>

1. Create a fresh archive release of uDig; copy in the jre and gdal_data as a a subfolder to the
   udig directory (as per the win32.sh shell script)</p>
<p>

2. Unzip your uDig release (ie the zip file created by the uDig Export Procedure) into
   deploy/installer/udig so that you have the following file structure:</p>
<pre>
    installer/uDigInstallScript.nsi
    installer/...
    installer/udig/ <-- extracted from your udig release
    installer/udig/.eclipseproduct
    installer/udig/configuration/
    installer/udig/features/
    installer/udig/gdal_data/
    installer/udig/icons/
    installer/udig/bsd3-v10.txt
    installer/udig/epl-v10.txt
    installer/udig/jre/
    installer/udig/plugins/
    installer/udig/udig.bat
    installer/udig/udig_internal.exe
    installer/udig/udig_internal.ini
</pre>
<p>
3. Next, open up uDigInstallScript.nsi, and edit the parts that state the version of uDig.
   This includes the following lines: 44,45,50,55,125,163,218,270,303
   (Replace VersionXXXX with whatever version you are working with for example 1.2-M4)</p>
<p>

4. use compiler to open the uDigInstallerScript.nsi file and it will compile the .exe in the same
   directory</p>
<p>

7. Hit Test Installer to runt it</p>
