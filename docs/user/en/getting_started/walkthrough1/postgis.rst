Adding a Layer from PostGIS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

  This section requires your own local PostGIS. While we have a public PostGIS available
  for demonstrations most corporate environments are unable to access this database due
  to firewall restrictions.

  If you are trapped behind a firewall please feel free to skip this section.

  The online help does have some advice about :doc:`/tasks/Running uDig` covering firewall access.

This section shows how you can add a Layer from a PostGIS table. PostGIS is an extension to the popular
open source PostgreSQL database. uDig handles other databases like Oracle and DB2 in a similar manner:

* Select :menuselection:`File --> New --> New Map` from the menu.

* In the :guilabel:`Projects` view, right-click on your map and select :guilabel:`Add`.

* Select :guilabel:`PostGIS` as the data source and click :guilabel:`Next`.

* Enter the following connection information:

  * Host: ``www.refractions.net``
  * Port: ``5432``
  * Username: ``demo``
  * Password: ``demo``
  * Store Password: check

  Once the connection information is entered press :guilabel:`Next`.

* This page lists the databases available to the current user.

  The www.refractions.net database does not publish a public list so rather than choose from a
  nice easy list we are going to have to enter in ``demo-bc`` by hand.

  * Database: ``demo-bc``

  |postgis_list_png|

* We can now press the :guilabel:`List` button to list the available tables. Please choose

  * :guilabel:`bc_hospitals`
  * :guilabel:`bc_municipality`

  Press :guilabel:`Next` when ready.

* The resource collection page confirms that :guilabel:`bc_hospitals` and :guilabel:`bc_municipality`
  are published as spatial layers.

  We can press :guilabel:`Finish` to add these layers to our Map.

* It may take a short while to fully render since you are zoomed out so far.

* Head on over the the :guilabel:`Layer` view and right click on :guilabel:`bc_hospitals` layer
  and choose :guilabel:`Zoom to Layer`

  |postgis_zoom_to_layer_png|

   The map will now zoom in to show the extent of the :guilabel:`bc_hospitals` layer.

* You can return to your previous position in the world by selecting Back in the Navigation menu.
