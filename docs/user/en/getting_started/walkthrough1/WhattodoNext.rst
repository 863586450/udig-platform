This is just the start of what uDig can do!

* Try out the :doc:`/reference/North Arrow` decorator and change projections in order to see how it works.

* There is more great data available in the data directory - have a look !

  This information has been collected by the `natural Earth <http://www.naturalearthdata.com/>`_ project. Their website
  contains more detailed downloads and a host of additional data.

  Try downloading the same data at several scales and compare the results.

* Try right-clicking on a Layer - there is plenty to do (especially in the :guilabel:`Operations` menu).

* Try making use of spatial information from your organisation or government.

* Try out the navigation tools such as :guilabel:`Zoom` and :guilabel:`Pan`.
  The :guilabel:`Navigation` menu lets you you retrace your steps.

  Changing coordinate reference system is also considered a navigation command.

* Advanced: Use the :guilabel:`Style Editor` to switch automatically from
  a raster layer to a web service.

  Switching based on scale allows for performance when zoomed out, while still
  providing full resolution when zoomed in.

* Advanced: Open the :guilabel:`Style Editor` and have a look at the
  :guilabel:`Advanced (XML)` page and see what you make of it.

* Perhaps you have an idea for the tool you always wanted?

  Developer tutorials including how to make a custom tool and create a custom
  application are available on the project web site.

* If you are not stuck behind a firewall you can try :doc:`postgis`.

* Additional features can be installed :doc:`InstallPlugin`.
