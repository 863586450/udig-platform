Importing data
##############

You can import into the application three ways:

-  By using the import wizard
-  By dragging files or urls to the Catalog view
-  By copying files or urls and pasting them into the Catalog view

You can also import information and add it to the current map in one step by using the Add Layer
wizard or dragging files or urls into the :doc:`/reference/Layers view`.

Import Wizard to directly add to the Catalog
============================================

You can use the Import Wizard to copy data into the applications catalog.

#. Open the :doc:`/reference/Import Wizard` by:

   -  Selecting :menuselection:`File --> Import` from the menu bar; or
   -  Pressing the |image0| **Import** button on the :doc:`/reference/Catalog view`

#. Select **Data** and click **Next**
#. Choose from the available data formats and click **Next**
#. Your imported data is now available in the **Catalog view**

Tips: You can also import files and urls by dragging them from the file system, or web browser, and
dropping them in the :doc:`/reference/Catalog view`, or by copying and pasting.
