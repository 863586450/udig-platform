~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Add Vertex Tool can select geometries and add vertices to those geometries. The workflow is the
same as adding vertices using the :doc:`Edit Geometry Tool`.

#. Click a feature to select it. **Tip** if features overlap clicking the same location multiple
   times will cycle through the features at that point.
#. Click on an edge to add a vertex.
#. Double click to accept change.
