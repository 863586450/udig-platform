Point Creation Tool â€“ Cannot resolve external resource into attachment.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Point Creation Tool allows points created. To create a point simply select a point layer in the
:doc:`/reference/Layers view` and click to create a new point.

Vertex Snapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default :doc:`snapping </reference/Snapping>` is turned off however, if desired Snapping
can be used during point geometry creation.

-  Point creation with snapping to the current layer.
-  Point creation with snapping to the all layers.
-  Point creation with snapping to the grid. The grid is only seen when the grid map graphic is on.
   **Layer > Grid**

Advanced Editing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Point Creation Tool also has an advanced mode that provides all the functionality that the
:doc:`Edit Geometry Tool` has, except only points can be edited. A summary of the advanced
editing features are:

-  Clicking an existing point will select it.
-  Vertices in selected points can be moved.
